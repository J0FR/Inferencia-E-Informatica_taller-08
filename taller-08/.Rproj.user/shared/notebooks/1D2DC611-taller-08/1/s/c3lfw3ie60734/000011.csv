"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict area with month, FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, temp, RH, wind and rain
(formula: area ~ month * FFMC * DMC * DC + ISI * temp * RH * wind * rain). The model explains a statistically not
significant and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.04, F(37, 479) = 0.59, p = 0.975, adj. R2 = -0.03). The model's
intercept, corresponding to month = 0, FFMC = 0, DMC = 0, DC = 0, ISI = 0, temp = 0, RH = 0, wind = 0 and rain = 0, is at

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence
Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.

"0","# Se encontra que ninguna de las variables evaluadas se encuentran asociadas al Ã¡rea total quemada por los incendios forestales en el parque natural Montesinho, Portugal. Ninguna de las variables evaluadas es estadisticamente significativa. Ademas, en el summary se puede evidenciar que ningun p value es menor a 0.05, lo que nos indica que las variables no son estadisticamente significativas."
